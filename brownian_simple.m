function [ xs, ts ] = brownian_simple( x0, T, h, sigma )
%BROWNIAN_SIMPLE Generate a trajectory of the Wiener process.
%   Args:
%     x0        Starting point, represented as a column vector of its 
%                 coordinates. Its length determines the dimension
%                 of the ambient space.
%     T         Duration of motion.
%     h         Time step.
%     sigma     Variance matrix of position at time 1. It must be symmetric
%                 and positive-definite.
%
%   Returns:
%     xs        Positions of particle in time `ts`.
%     ts        Time mesh.
